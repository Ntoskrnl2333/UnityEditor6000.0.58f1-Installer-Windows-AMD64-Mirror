=============================================================

This repository hosts the Windows AMD64 installer of **Unity Editor 6.0.0.58f1 (LTS)** along with Target Platform Support Moudles installers.  
All installers are uploaded in split archive format (`*.7z.001`, `*.7z.002`, …) to work around GitHub’s file size limits.

*Note: Download **all** parts of the archive you want (e.g. `*.7z.001` ~ `*.7z.0??`) before extraction. If any part is missing, 7-Zip will refuse to extract.*
